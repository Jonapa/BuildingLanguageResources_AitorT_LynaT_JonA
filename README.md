## Description

We introduce the Milei corpus, a small but extensible dataset in Argentinian Spanish created to measure Hate Speech in the political domain. It consists of 140 Reddit comments annotated by the authors of this report. Through this workpiece, we attempt to contribute to Hate Speech analysis in social media by following good practices. To achieve our goal, we provide a description of the process and methods carried out: we massively collected Argentina politics-related comments and then manually selected 140 for annotation. We wrote the guidelines for the annotation procedure and tested them by calculating inter-annotator agreement. We also highlight the annotators demographics, the difficulties when creating Hate Speech corpora and the limitations we found during the process.
